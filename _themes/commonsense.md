My research tries to bring common sense understanding to robotic perception. 
Interacting with the environment requires to perceive objects and understand how actions influence their movement ad shape. 

Generative perception models can make sense of partial and noisy observations and reconstruct their shape and semantics

.

Understanding the intuitive physics of interacting with objects will provide 
next-generation automonous agents with a common sense knowledge base for interacting with a complex, dynamic environment
