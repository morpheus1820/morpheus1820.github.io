I do research in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at [Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)](http://iit.it), in the [Humanoid Sensing and Perception lab](https://hsp.iit.it/home), with Lorenzo Natale.

My research interests include [`visual language navigation`](themes/VLN) for mobile robotics, using `computer vision` and `ML` to bring [`common sense`](themes/commonsense) understanding to robotic perception, and [`human-robot interaction`](themes/HRI).

I was a research fellow at University of Oxford (UK), under supervision of Prof. Niki Trigoni, working on the ESPRC Programme Grant "Mobile Robotics: Enabling a Pervasive Technology of the Future". I was assistant researcher at Politecnico di Torino (Italy), working in collaboration with Telecom Italia S.P.A. I was a PhD student in Robotics at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) and Politecnico di Torino, working on space robotics and service robotics.
